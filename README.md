# Capstone-Project-2023

Welcome to my final year Capstone project done in 2023!

My project was a Unity game and a React.js Website. I wanted the game to act as my product and website was for marketing and distribution of the game. Medieval Magic was built in C# using blender aswell to make my models and I used Javascript, CSS and HTML to make my website. 

Here is the website URL - https://medievalmagicgame.com/
